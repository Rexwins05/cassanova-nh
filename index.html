            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Casanova is an Incubus with human features who thinks of seducing his prey as a game and would make a habit of trying to charm his prey first before resorting to more drastic measures like using his abilities.</p>
            <p> He acts like the ideal partner, taking on the characteristics that the target finds attractive but will instantly turn rude and cocky when he gets bored of toying with them.</p>
            <p>He often leads his victims to heartbreak forcing his ideals onto them that love is a myth. Merely a ruse made to destroy everything good. Casanova's bitterness stems from his previous life as a prince who was to be wedded to a knight named William.</p>
            <p> Their marriage was taboo and unwelcome in the small kingdom of Iceaphate. His fiance convinced him to remove the obstacles that stopped them from marrying by murdering his brother and father in cold blood so he would be the sole heir to the kingdom.</p>
            <p> On the night of their wedding Zachary caught William with a woman and ran away into the night eventually getting caught by William who in return drove a sword through his husbands heart ultimately revealing that he only seduced Zachary with the intent to inherit the kingdom.</p>
            <p> Julian, Zachary's only friend with a secret of his own followed them failing to stop William from murdering Zachary but in return took the life of the knight.</p>
            <p> In his final goodbye Julian exchanged his life in order to save Zacharys, shifting his curse onto his friend, renaming him Casanova the Incubus. </p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>He looks and acts like the perfect partner but in reality he's a selfish, lying, unsympathetic and flirtatious man who'll kill anyone he feeds off without feeling the pressure of guilt or shame, often viewing his targets as toys and food.</p>
            <p> He can't stand the idea of love, but loves attention, often having a flair for the dramatics.</p>
            <p> When his victims proclaim their love to him he bitterly claims that if they did they would cut out their heart and give it to him as an offering knowing full well it would kill them viewing their death as a punishment for being so foolish as to believe in an old wives tale.</p>
